Over the course of her summer internship she made significant improvements in her coding ability, particularly in style and testability. I was impressed with her ability to learn and tie together various large, proprietary platforms to create a working system within a short time frame. She managed to do this with very minimal guidance.\n\nShe demonstrated strength in topics that are typically lacking in new college graduates: appreciation for total cost of software ownership and operations, passion for quality software and sensitivity to business constraints.\n\nI’m glad to have had the experience of working with her over the summer. Anusha would be valuable asset to any project. See less"
