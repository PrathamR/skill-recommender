In addition to log parsing & normalization, and wrappers around elasticsearch, she built the entire system around them - dockerization, load balancing, high availability, clustering, docker orchestration using ansible. She's been one of the most trusted engineers of the team. She was extremely responsive to production issues and requests, root-causing with quick turnarounds.\n\nShe is a very fast learner, quickly grasping new languages and tools. She was a great asset to ELK team and a great team player. She has always been helping others, sharing her knowledge and striving to learn from them. Extremely sincere and responsible, she's definitely someone you can consistently count on. She will be a great addition to any team. Yes, I would rehire her any day. See less"
