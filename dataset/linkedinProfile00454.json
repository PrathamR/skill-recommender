      "description": "Member of MATLAB Enterprise Deployment team, currently working on the product MATLAB\nProduction Server (MPS) to provide deployment solutions for MATLAB based applications in a\nclient-server environment to solve important issues like scalability and reliability. Working to provide solutions to Java, .NET, Python and Excel clients.\n\n• Currently working on adding support for an Asynchronous Client API for the Java MPS Client. The API provides Future-based results and a listener interface for status updates. The internal\nimplementation must keep state for every outstanding request on multiple server instances and\nupdate them as the request state changes on the server.\n\n• Designed and implemented an API, in Java and C#, that allows users to dynamically invoke\nMATLAB functions deployed on the server. This required a full refactoring of the existing client\ncode for both languages.\n\n• Designed and implemented the Python MLArray, a multi-dimensional array implementation for\nPython that could be serialized/deserialized to/from MATLAB. This is a core component of the\nMATLAB Python interface which is used by multiple teams inside MathWorks.\n\n• Designed and implemented the Python Client and user-facing API for the MATLAB Production\nServer. Users can now call MATLAB functions deployed on the production server from Python.\nThe client is responsible for encoding/decoding between Python and MATLAB data structures;\nproviding access to MATLAB functions available on the server; and interacting with the server\nthrough a RESTful API.\n\n• Worked on data conversion library for marshaling non scalar data between MATLAB types and\ntypes supported by other languages like Java, C# and Excel, using Google Protocol Buffers for data serialization.
